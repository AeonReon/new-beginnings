// MOMENTS OF WONDER — the little words to say when the world does something.
//
// "Star light, star bright" is the model. A child sees the first star, says
// four lines that every generation before them has said, makes a wish, and the
// evening is marked. It costs nothing, needs no kit, and it is remembered for
// sixty years.
//
// Most of these moments are still happening — the swallows still come back in
// April, the dandelion clocks still blow — but the words that went with them
// have mostly stopped being handed on. A child now has plenty of language for
// what is wrong and almost none for what is wonderful. This is that language,
// gathered back up.
//
// THE RULES THIS FILE IS WRITTEN UNDER
//   1. NOTHING DARK. No curses, no omens, no sorrow-counting, no wishing the
//      weather away. Where the old rhyme has a nasty tail ("your house is on
//      fire", "one for sorrow") it is either left out entirely or a warm
//      version is written to replace it, clearly marked. Wonder only.
//   2. HONEST ABOUT WHERE THE WORDS CAME FROM. `by` is either the real
//      tradition or 'Ours' — a verse written for this app. Never dress our own
//      lines up as folk tradition, and never print a lyric still in copyright.
//   3. NOTHING ASSERTED AS FACT THAT ISN'T. A wish is presented as a wish. The
//      blessings are presented from inside the tradition that says them, at
//      full strength, with a plain-words alternative where a family doesn't
//      pray. The `why` is the real, observable reason it does a child good —
//      never "because it's lucky".
//   4. EVERY ENTRY MUST BE DOABLE THIS YEAR IN NORTHERN IRELAND. No fireflies,
//      no monsoons. Swallows, lambs, brent geese, Merry Dancers, blackberries.

    by:'Traditional',
    how:"Go to a window or the back step as the light goes. The first one out is usually not a star at all — it's Venus, and it's the brightest thing up there after the moon. Say the four lines together. Then everyone makes a wish silently and keeps it to themselves. That's the whole thing, and it takes forty seconds.",
    why:"This is the smallest possible ritual and it does three things at once. It makes a child stop and look up, which almost nothing else in their day asks them to do. It gives them a set of words that are the same every time, and repeated words are what a memory hooks onto years later. And it asks them, quietly, what do you actually want — which is a question a small child is rarely given room to answer.",
    origin:"Recorded in America in the late 1800s and sung across the English-speaking world ever since. The custom underneath it — wishing on the first star — is much older than the rhyme.",
    variant:"Older children like the astronomy: the 'first star' in the west in the evening is very often Venus, a whole planet, close enough that its light left it about five minutes ago."

    by:'Traditional Gaelic — Carmina Gadelica (Alexander Carmichael, 1900)',
    how:"When you first catch the new crescent, stop and bow your head to it — a small nod is enough — and say the words. Then the old part: turn over a coin in your pocket and wish the month well. Children love the coin. Keep one in a jar by the door for it.",
    why:"A month is far too long a thing for a small child to hold in their head. Marking the start of one with a gesture gives them a handle on it — this shape in the sky means a new stretch of time is starting, and it is the same shape every time. It is the oldest calendar there is, and it works without a screen or a number.",
    origin:"Alexander Carmichael spent forty years walking the Hebrides writing down the prayers and charms people still said out loud, and published them as the Carmina Gadelica in 1900. Bowing or curtseying to the new moon, and turning silver in the pocket, was done all over Ireland, Scotland and Cornwall.",

    by:'Traditional — the Irish version',
    how:"Take them outside, or hold them at an upstairs window with the light off so their eyes adjust. Say it slowly. Then let them look for the shapes on it — the dark patches have names, and the one everybody sees first is called the Man in the Moon in Ireland and a rabbit in half of Asia.",
    why:"Two people looking at the same thing and naming it together is the oldest teaching there is — long before any lesson, a child learns what is worth looking at by watching what the adults they love turn their heads towards. Bedtime is also when a child's guard is lowest, so a calm, repeated, out-loud thing at that hour lands deeper than the same words at noon.",
    origin:"The first two lines were printed in Gammer Gurton's Garland in 1784; the cottage-and-hall couplet is the version that stayed alive in Ireland.",

    by:'Ours — the custom is very old, the couplet is not',
    how:"There is no time to say anything before it goes, so the rule is: wish first, say the words after. Teach them that. Then everyone says what they saw — how long it lasted, which way it went — because half the pleasure of a rare thing is checking that the other person got it too.",
    why:"A child who sees one of these remembers it for decades, and the reason is that it cannot be repeated on demand. Almost everything else in a modern childhood can be played again. This one cannot, and that is exactly what makes it stick — the brain marks the unrepeatable.",
    origin:"Wishing on a falling star is written down in Europe as far back as the second century, when Ptolemy suggested the gods must have opened the sky to look out, and a wish could slip through the gap.",

    why:"Northern Ireland gets more rainbows than almost anywhere, and a thing you see often is a thing a child stops seeing. Hanging one small habit on it — say a good thing — turns the most ordinary sight here into a moment where the family says out loud what it is glad about. Children are surrounded by language for what is wrong and short of language for what is right; this quietly gives them some.",
    origin:"There is no kind old rainbow rhyme in these islands worth handing on — the surviving weather ones are all warnings. So we wrote one.",
    variant:"The trick that makes them gasp: a rainbow is always directly opposite the sun. If it is raining and the sun is out, turn your back to the sun and it will be in front of you. You can predict where one will appear, which feels like magic and is only geometry."

    by:'Ours',
    how:"Pick the night before and tell them it is happening — the anticipation is half of it. Blanket, coats over pyjamas, out the door. Watch it properly: the sky colours before the sun itself is up, and the whole thing from first light to full disc is about twenty minutes. Hot chocolate afterwards, back to bed if they want.",
    why:"A child's day is normally arranged for them and starts when they are told. Being woken early on purpose, for something that is not school and not an appointment, tells them something is worth getting up for that is not useful in any way at all. That is a lesson about what life is for, delivered without a word of it being said.",
    origin:"In winter here the sun does not come up until nearly nine, so December and January are the easy months to do this — you barely have to get up early at all.",

    by:'Traditional',
    how:"Say it, then make the prediction out loud together: \"So tomorrow should be a good day.\" Write it on the calendar if you like. The point is to check tomorrow and see whether you were right.",
    why:"This is the rare old saying that is actually mostly true, and that is the whole reason to use it. Our weather comes from the west. A red sunset means the western sky is clear enough to let the low sun through, and that clear air is what is coming to you overnight. A child who makes a prediction and then checks it has just done the entire scientific method in eighteen hours, and enjoyed it.",
    origin:"Said in these islands for at least five hundred years; a version of it appears in the Gospel of Matthew, so it is a good deal older than that.",

    by:'Ours',
    how:"Just point. Small children find a daytime moon genuinely startling, because they have decided the moon belongs to the night. Let the surprise sit for a second before you explain anything.",
    why:"Being wrong about something small and finding out cheerfully is a skill, and it has to be practised on things that do not matter before it can be used on things that do. A daytime moon is a perfect, harmless little contradiction of what a child was sure about.",
    origin:"It happens for about half of every month; we mostly do not look up in daylight.",
    variant:"Older ones can work out the rule: a moon visible in the afternoon is waxing, one visible in the morning is waning. Two weeks of checking and they will have it."

    why:"Almost every wonder on this page is one a child cannot influence. This is the one where you can tell them the exact minute it will happen, and then it happens, on time, because someone worked it out. That is a very good thing for a child to watch an adult do — predict the sky and be right.",
    origin:"It is the size of a football pitch, about 250 miles up, going seventeen and a half thousand miles an hour, with seven people aboard. It is the third-brightest thing in the sky after the sun and moon.",
    variant:"If they ask why it does not blink: aeroplanes have flashing lights, satellites do not. That one rule lets a child identify it themselves for ever after."

December 13th to 14th (the Geminids) is better but freezing. Lie on your backs on a rug facing away from any light, give your eyes twenty minutes to adjust, and do not look at a phone once — it undoes the twenty minutes instantly. Count them out loud.",
    why:"Twenty minutes lying still in the dark waiting is the actual gift here, not the meteors. There is almost no other circumstance in which a modern child will be still and quiet outdoors with nothing happening, willingly, because something is about to. Patience learnt while excited is patience that sticks.",
    origin:"The Perseids are the dust trail of comet Swift-Tuttle, which the Earth drives through every August. So the child is watching a comet's dust burn up — the same dust, every year, for as long as anyone has been looking.",

    by:'Ours — "Merry Dancers" (Na Fir Chlis) is the traditional Ulster and Scots name',
    how:"Sign up for an aurora alert so you actually find out — they mostly happen while everyone is asleep. Get away from streetlights and face north; the north coast, the Sperrins and Lough Neagh's north shore are the best bets in Northern Ireland. To the naked eye it often looks like a pale grey-green glow rather than the photographs; a phone camera on night mode will show the colour your eye cannot.",
    why:"Waking a child at midnight for something is an enormous event in their life. The rarity is the whole point — the ones you get out of bed for are the nights they will still be describing to their own children.",
    origin:"In Ulster and Scotland the aurora was the Merry Dancers, in Irish Na Fir Chlis, the nimble men. Northern Ireland is far enough north to get them several times a year in a strong solar cycle.",
    variant:"Being cheated is part of it. Plenty of nights the alert goes off, everyone gets up, and there is nothing but cloud. Have the hot chocolate anyway — the going out is the ritual, not the seeing."

    why:"Nothing trains imagination like being handed something almost shapeless and asked to make it into something. And having to find the shape someone else has seen is quiet, real practice at getting inside another head — the same muscle used for kindness, worked on something with no stakes at all.",
    origin:"Older than record. Hamlet does it in Act 3, which suggests it was already an old joke in 1600.",

    why:"Something that leaves and comes back on time is deeply reassuring to a child, and there is very little in a modern year that does it visibly. The stars going away in spring and returning in autumn, exactly, without fail, is a demonstration that the world has a rhythm and is not simply a series of things that happen.",
    origin:"Orion has been recognised as a figure for at least seventeen thousand years — a mammoth-ivory carving from a German cave may be the oldest star map we have.",
    variant:"The middle star of the three is about 1,200 light years away, so the light hitting your child's eye left it around the time of the Vikings. Say that outside, in the cold, and watch it land."

    how:"The only rule is: absolutely still, and whisper. Do not try to keep it and do not touch the wings. Say the verse under your breath, make a wish, and let it decide when to go. If it stays a while, count slowly — the counting keeps a small child still.",
    why:"Being chosen by a wild animal, even for four seconds, does something to a child that no amount of being told they are special can do. And the price of it is stillness and quiet — so this is the one moment where a child will hold themselves perfectly still and want to.",

That first safe contact with something alive and not a pet is worth protecting, and the gentleness it demands — do not squeeze, do not grab — is a real lesson learnt in about four seconds.",

    why:"Most wild animals treat a person as a threat. One that treats you as useful is a completely different relationship, and a child who works out that standing still and being patient brings a bird nearer has learnt something they cannot be told.",
    origin:"They follow us because we look like wild boar. On the continent robins follow boar turning up the leaf litter; here we cleared the boar, so they transferred to gardeners.",

Tell a child that while they are looking at it and they will not forget it. It is also the clearest possible signal that the dark half of the year is over.",

    variant:"Bealtaine, the 1st of May, was the start of the Irish summer. Hawthorn — the May — is usually out for it."

    by:'Ours',
    how:"In June, stay up until the light finally goes — after eleven here, and further north on the Antrim coast it barely gets properly dark at all. In December, do the opposite: candles at four o'clock, everything switched off, and mark the shortest afternoon of the year on purpose.",
    why:"These two days are the frame the whole year hangs on and almost no child is shown them. Once a child has stayed up for the light in June and lit candles in the dark in December, the year stops being a flat sequence of days and becomes a shape they can feel.",
    origin:"Marked at Newgrange for five thousand years — the midwinter sunrise still comes down the passage on the shortest mornings.",
    variant:"After the shortest day, tell them the light is coming back now, a little every day. Children find that genuinely cheering, and it is true."

    how:"Light one candle on the table on a night when nothing whatsoever is happening. Turn the big light off. Let a child light it, with help, because being trusted with fire is enormous.",
    why:"If ceremony only ever appears on birthdays and Christmas, a child learns that ordinary days are the ones you get through. One candle on a Tuesday says the opposite, at a cost of nothing, and it is a belief about life that will still be operating in them at fifty.",
    origin:"Nothing traditional. It is simply the cheapest possible way to make a night different.",
    variant:"Blowing it out at the end is the child's job, and worth saying something small over: \"That's Tuesday done. It was a good one.\""
